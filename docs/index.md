## What's librerpi?

Librerpi is an effort to bring free boot firmware to the RaspberryPi,
replacing the proprietary `bootcode.bin` normally loaded from the
SDÂ Card. While most of the things work fine (on the Pi2), we do not 
recommend using it for production. This is still in an Alpha stage.

## Isn't the RaspberryPi firmware already free?

No, it's proprietary.

The firmware is available *only* as a binary, which makes it 
nonfree.

## This website

This website is still not complete, there may be dead links, 
among other things. If you see a broken thing on this website, 
that's a bug and needs to be reported.

This website uses markdown files for its documentation and then 
uses [learn](http://vitali64.duckdns.org/?p=utils/learn.git) to 
compile them into html files, adding CSS, the header, among other 
things.
