## How can I submit documentation?

Your page **must** be written in markdown, 
it should be put in the docs/ directory.

Please note that 'learn' (the documentation 
generator used) uses the first line of the 
file as the title, for example:

	Hello World
	===========

	How are you?

The title will be "Hello World".
